Help for understanding the files

lunix.h ---> header file

lunix.mod.c ---> sets up metadata, symbol info, core sectors(init and cleanup) and other info. Basically informs kernel for smooth running  

lunix.attach.c ---> communication between tty and kernal

lunix-chrdev.c --->

lunix-chrdev.h ---> header file for lunix-chrdev.c

lunix-ldisc.h ---> The lunix-ldisc.c file implements a custom TTY line discipline for the Lunix:TNG kernel module. A line discipline acts as an intermediary between the TTY driver and higher-level applications or protocols, enabling data processing for serial devices.

lunix-module.c ---> initialization, clean up and managment of sensors, line discipline, and character device components

lunix-protocol.c ---> proccess data packets (includes debugging options)

lunix-protocol.h ---> header file for lunix-protocol.c

lunix-sensors.c ---> has function to initialize update and delete sensors

lunix-tcp.sh ---> usage: ./lunix-tcp.sh dir/to/send/data 
This Bash script connects to a TCP server (lunix.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:49152) and forwards incoming data to a specified pseudo-terminal slave (PTS) port using the socat utility. It verifies that exactly one argument (the PTS port) is provided and checks if socat is installed. If either condition fails, it exits with an error message. When run successfully, it uses socat in unidirectional mode to forward the TCP data to the given PTS device.

mk-lunix-devs.sh ---> generates nodes

mk-lunix-lookup.c ---> has function to convert the info we got from sensors into battery/temperature/light
